# Kinodynamic Path Planning 

This path planning consider the robot's current state as well as kinodynamic
constraints of the robot to select the path to the goal.

Inspired by ![Fast-Planner](https://github.com/HKUST-Aerial-Robotics/Fast-Planner)
It modifies the heusteric in A* Algorithm to give a cost to the kinodynamic
change in the robot from current state to next state.
